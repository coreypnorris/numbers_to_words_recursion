##Numbers to words using recursion

####This is a ruby method that uses recursion for returning a passed in integer as a string. For example numbers_in_words(8) should equal "eight"

This method isn't quite working yet and is in need of some refactoring. However, you're still able to use it if you would like to. Just copy the code from the lib/numbers_in_words.rb file and paste it into a ruby client ([Here's a link](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/installing-ruby) that helped me install ruby on my machine). Then type â€˜numbers_in_words(your-number-here)' in the client.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/numbers-in-words-in-ruby) was meant to stretch the limits of our Ruby understanding and skills.
